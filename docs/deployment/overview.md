# Deploying services on the platform

This documentation page is currently under development. Once the platform is published in its beta version, you will find the necessary tutorials for deploying your digital service here. In the meantime, you can follow the tutorials for [building a service](/docs/getting-started/starterkit.md) for the NaLamKI platform. 

When you are ready to deploy your service on the platform you can develop your service as an edge module and you will use [Kubernetes (with Helm)](https://helm.sh/) for deployment.

**Recap**: Edge deployment involves running applications or services closer to the data source, reducing latency and improving performance. Kubernetes is an open-source platform for automating containerized applications' deployment, scaling, and management, while Helm is a package manager for Kubernetes that simplifies the deployment and management of applications.
