# Introduction

This webpage provides a detailed documentation of the open-source software developed as part of the NaLamKI project. At present, users will find a software development kit (SDK) that enables them to develop their own services for the platform, published [here](https://github.com/NaLamKI/SDK). The documentation for the SDK's is continously improved and extended. 

We also include example services that are published in a tutorial-style format to help users get familiar with developing software services for the NaLamKI platform. These [step-by-step examples](./getting-started/starterkit.md) will guide users through the process of creating agricultural applications, such as crop monitoring, soil analysis, or irrigation management tools. By following these tutorials, users can learn best practices for integrating AI models, utilizing sensor data, and deploying cloud-based services tailored to agriculture. At this time a super simple service that processes an image, detects its green values and publishes its geodata can be found in these tutorials. We are working on publishing a fruit detection service as tutorial by autumn 2024.

Additionally, the paper includes a theoretical overview of the platform's [architecture](./architecture/dashboard.md), offering insights into its structure and functionality. 

Once the platform is released in a beta version, the documentation will be expanded to include instructions for [deploying services on the platform](./deployment/overview.md), allowing users to integrate their custom solutions seamlessly into the NaLamKI ecosystem.

## NaLamKI's Goal

The NaLamKI project aims to make agricultural processes more efficient and sustainable through the use of cloud and AI technologies. To achieve this, a Gaia-X-compliant Software-as-a-Service platform is being developed, where agricultural sensor and machine data are collected. AI applications available on the platform assist farmers in analyzing the condition of crops and soil over large areas, thereby supporting processes such as irrigation, fertilization, and pest control.


## Use of NaLamKI for Agriculture

NaLamKI will significantly simplify and speed up the monitoring of crops on large agricultural areas. Remote data collection, such as through drones or satellites, combined with AI-driven models for weather and crop development forecasts, provides extensive insights into the condition of cultivation areas that were previously scarcely available. Farmers will be able to detect and locate issues such as irrigation and fertilization deficiencies or pest infestations early on. This not only accelerates processes significantly but also allows for a much more targeted use of pesticides or fertilizers, leading to substantial cost savings, reduced environmental impact, and improved climate resilience.

## Getting Started

If you want to develop some services for the NaLamKI infrastructure you can follow a first developers tutorial in our [Getting Started Area](./getting-started/starterkit.md).
