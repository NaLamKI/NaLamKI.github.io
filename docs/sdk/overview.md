# What is the SDK? 

The SDK is a software development kit for the NaLamKI platform, comparable to a code library. Using it helps in developing digital services using agricultural data and makes your service compatible with the NaLamKI platform. You can download the SDK [here](https://github.com/NaLamKI/SDK).

It will help you set up a client to connect with our servers, structure and process your data, and deploy your service on the platform. If you have not implemented the [DummyGreenDetectionModel](/docs/getting-started/starterkit.md) as a first hands-on project with the nalamki-sdk you should check it out and try it yourself - we are looking forward to your feedback!
