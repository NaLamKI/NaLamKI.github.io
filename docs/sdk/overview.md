# What are the SDK's? 

The SDK's are a software development kit for the NaLamKI platform, it's basically like a code library. Using them makes it easier to develop digital services using agricultural data and makes your service compatible with the NaLamKI platform. You can download the SDK's [here](https://github.com/NaLamKI/SDK).

They will help you set up a client to connect with our servers, structure and process your data, and deploy your service on the platform. If you have not implemented the [DummyGreenDetectionModel](/docs/getting-started/starterkit.md) as a first hands-on project with the nalamki-sdk's you should check it out and try it yourself - we are looking forward to your feedback!
