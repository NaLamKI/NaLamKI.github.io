# Host-App Bridge

For developers of an extension's frontend, and for host-app developers who
implement the other side of the bridge.

An extension runs in one of three places, and `/_sdk/bridge.js` — served by every
extension — is the one script for all of them. It wraps them in a small object,
`AppExt`:

| Where | How it talks to the host app |
|-------|------------------------------|
| The host app on a phone | a JavaScript channel named `AppExtBridge` in the web view |
| The host's **web** app | the extension sits in an `<iframe>` under the app's own header; `postMessage` to the parent, and only to the web app's origin(s) (`APPEXT_APP_ORIGINS`) |
| An ordinary browser tab | nothing: every call is a quiet no-op that returns `false` — an extension must work here too |

The third row is also where an extension lands whose manifest says
`display = "external"`, and where it lands on a platform that has no host app at
all.

**The SDK loads `bridge.js` into every HTML page it serves**, so nobody has to
remember. Include it by hand only for pages your own code renders.

```html
<script src="/_sdk/bridge.js"></script>
<script src="/app.js"></script>      <!-- no inline script: the CSP is default-src 'self' -->
```

```js
AppExt.setTitle("Reports");
const off = AppExt.onTheme((theme) => (document.documentElement.dataset.theme = theme));
AppExt.openExternal("https://example.org/help");
AppExt.close();
```

| Call | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `AppExt.inApp` | `true` inside the host app — the phone app's web view, or the web app's frame. |
| `AppExt.close()` | Closes the extension's screen. |
| `AppExt.setTitle(text)` | Sets the app bar title above the extension. |
| `AppExt.openExternal(url)` | Asks the host app to open an `https` URL in the system browser. The host app decides which addresses it accepts. |
| `AppExt.onTheme(callback)` | Called with `"light"` or `"dark"` now (if known) and on every change; returns an unsubscribe function. |
| `AppExt.onLanguage(callback)` | The same, with the app's language code. |

## What the bridge deliberately does not do

**No data.** No command returns a token, a user name or anything else from the
app. Data flows through the extension's own backend, authenticated by the
session. The app accepts exactly the fixed commands above, ignores unknown ones,
and takes them **only while the web view is on the extension's own host** — an
extension that navigates elsewhere loses the bridge.

## What the SDK needs to know about the host app

The script cannot ask the host app anything, so the extension is told through its
configuration; the auth bundle of a platform with a host app carries these:

| Variable | What the bridge does with it | Default |
|----------|------------------------------|---------|
| `APPEXT_APP_ORIGINS` | the origin(s) of the web app: the only ones it talks to and listens to in a frame, and the target of the bar's way back | empty: no web app, no bar |
| `APPEXT_APP_MARKER` | the part of the user agent that says "inside the phone app" | `-App-WebView/` |
| `APPEXT_APP_NAME` | the app's name in the bar and the arrow's label | empty: "the app" |
| `APPEXT_APP_BACK_LABELS` | the arrow's label per language, a JSON object; `{app}` stands for the name | `Back to {app}` |
| `APPEXT_APP_ACCENT` | the colour of the arrow and of the name | the bridge's default |

## In a browser tab: the way back

Opened outside the app — in a tab, say from "open in browser" — the page gets a
**bar on top**: a back arrow, the extension's name and, at the right, the name of
the host app. The arrow closes the tab if the web app opened it, and otherwise
leads to the web app. The bar appears only when a web app is configured and the
page is neither in the phone app nor in a frame. A page with its own navigation
switches it off:

```html
<meta name="appext-shell" content="off">
```

## Wire format

For anyone implementing the app side or testing without it:

```text
extension -> app   AppExtBridge.postMessage(JSON.stringify({command: "close"}))        (phone app)
                   parent.postMessage(JSON.stringify({command: "close"}), appOrigin)    (web app, iframe)
                   {command: "setTitle", title: "…"}
                   {command: "openExternal", url: "https://…"}
                   {command: "ready"}        (iframe only: the page is up — the app answers with theme and language)
app -> extension   window event "appext:theme" (detail "light" | "dark"), "appext:language" (detail "en" …),
                   and window.AppExtState for a script that loads later          (phone app)
                   frame.contentWindow.postMessage('{"appext":"event","type":"theme","value":"dark"}', extensionOrigin)
                   — turned by bridge.js into the same window event              (web app, iframe)
```

In the web app a message counts only from the frame itself and only from an
origin the page lists in `APPEXT_APP_ORIGINS`; `bridge.js` never posts to `*`.

The bridge is optional: an extension that never loads `bridge.js` loses nothing
but the title and theme integration. What a host app has to implement is part of
the [platform contract](./platform-contract.md#the-host-app).
